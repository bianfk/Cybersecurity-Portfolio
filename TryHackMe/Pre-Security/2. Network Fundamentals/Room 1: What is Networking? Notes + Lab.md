## Room completed: What is networking?

Date: 7/16/25

### â—¦What I learned:
<br>
A computer network can be formed by 2 or more devices. It can be one of two types: A private or public network. 
Devices identify using IP addresses (Internet Protocol) and MAC (Media Access Control) addresses. 
IPv4 looks like 192.168.1.1  and IPv6 looks something like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. IPv4 is limited to 4.29 billion. 
IPv6 (340 trillion plus). MAC address is unique to each device and looks to something like a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d where the first 
six characters represent the network interface manufacturer, and the last six represent its unique address. MAC addresses can 
be spoofed. Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between 2 
devices, and if that connection exists.

## Lab completed: How to ping?

Pinging 8.8.8.8 informs us that we have sent 4 packets, all of which were received at an average of 9.428 seconds.
### Why does this matter to SOC analysts?
Helps understand how computers connects
