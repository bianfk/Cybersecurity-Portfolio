# 🛠️ SOC Projects: Tools & Scripting in Action

This repository highlights my hands-on experience using **industry-relevant tools and scripting languages** to perform core Security Operations Center (SOC) functions such as log analysis, detection engineering, automation, and incident response.

Each folder contains projects or scripts built with a specific tool or language that demonstrates how I’ve applied it in practical, SOC-relevant ways.
