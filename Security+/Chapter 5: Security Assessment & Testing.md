# 📘 Chapter 5: Security Assessment & Testing

📅 **Date Completed:** 2025-09-10  
📚 **Topic:** Vulnerability management, threat hunting, audits, and testing

---

## 🔑 Key Concept

- **Vulnerability Management** is the process of finding, analyzing, fixing, and verifying security weaknesses in systems.
- **Penetration Testing** simulates attacks to see how secure a system really is.
- **Audits** help verify that security policies and controls are working and organizations are following rules.
- **Threat Hunting** is when security teams proactively look for threats instead of waiting for alerts.

## 🛠️ Tools/Techniques

- Vulnerability Scanners  
- CVE & CVSS scoring systems  
- Bug Bounty programs  
- Security audits (internal & external)  
- Threat hunting frameworks  

---

## 🛡️ SOC Relevance

- Knowing how vulns are discovered + scored helps analysts prioritize threats  
- Helps understand reports from scanners like Nessus or OpenVAS  
- Audits + pentest reports help SOC teams improve defenses  
- Threat hunting is a key part of advanced Blue Team activity

## 📝 Summary

This chapter focused on how organizations test and improve security. I learned about vulnerability scanning and how issues get scored (like CVSS scores). It also talked about bug bounty programs, penetration testing types, and how companies validate fixes by rescanning. Audits were a big section too — both internal and external. One thing that stood out is threat hunting, which means searching for hidden threats before alerts even happen. Overall, this chapter helped me see how structured and continuous security testing really is.
