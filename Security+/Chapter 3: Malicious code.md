# 📘 Chapter 3: Malicious Code

📚 **Topic:** Malware Types & Indicators of Malicious Activity

## 🔑 Key Concept

- **Types of Malware:** I learned the main types of malware like viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, ransomware, and more. Each one works differently but they all try to harm, steal, or spy on systems.

- **Ransomware & Keyloggers:** Ransomware locks files and asks for payment. Keyloggers silently record everything you type—really creepy. These are two of the most dangerous types if you ask me.

- **Logic Bombs & Rootkits:** These are sneaky. Logic bombs are like hidden traps that go off when triggered, and rootkits hide deep in the system so you don’t even know they’re there.

## 🛠️ Tools/Techniques

- **Antivirus Software** – helps detect common malware  
- **Process Monitor / Task Manager** – can show suspicious programs  
- **SIEM Tools** – to alert when weird behavior happens  
- **File Integrity Monitoring** – checks for unauthorized changes

## 🛡️ SOC Relevance

- Malware analysis is **super important** in a SOC role. Analysts need to spot signs of infection quickly.  
- Knowing what each malware type does helps with **triage** and **incident response**.  
- This chapter really ties into **log analysis**—understanding how malware behaves helps spot it faster in alerts.

## 📝 Summary

Malicious code is basically any software that does something bad, and there are sooo many kinds! At first it was a bit overwhelming, but now I can tell the difference between a virus and a trojan, or a rootkit and a logic bomb. This stuff is really sneaky and makes me realize how important it is to stay alert. I also see now why malware detection is a huge part of working in a SOC—if you miss the signs, things can go bad fast. Still learning, but this chapter made the dangers feel real.
