## 🔑 Key Concept

- **Types of Threat Actors:** There are different kinds of attackers out there—like nation-states, insider threats, hacktivists, and even people who just want money or revenge. Not all attackers are the same, and some are more skilled than others.

- **Attack Motivations:** Some attackers want to steal data, some just want to cause chaos, and others might be doing it for political reasons. Understanding why helps predict what they might do next.

- **Attack Surfaces & Vectors:** I learned the difference between *how* attacks happen (vectors like email, USBs, vulnerable software) and *where* attacks can happen (attack surfaces, like open ports or weak passwords).

## 🛠️ Tools/Techniques

- **Email & Phishing Messages** – common vector  
- **Removable Devices** – USBs can be dangerous  
- **Default Credentials** – attackers love weak logins  
- **Supply Chain Attacks** – hitting vendors or MSPs

## 🛡️ SOC Relevance

- Helps SOC analysts understand **who the attacker might be** and **why they’re attacking**  
- Knowing vectors helps spot suspicious behavior (like weird USB activity or open ports)  
- Helps with **threat hunting**, since you can connect motivations with possible indicators

## 📝 Summary

This chapter explained who the bad guys are and why they do what they do. I honestly didn’t realize how many different types of attackers exist, or that things like unsecured Bluetooth or outdated apps could be a real danger. I'm starting to see how attackers think, which seems super important if you're going to stop them. Still figuring it all out, but this definitely made me think more critically about threat detection.
