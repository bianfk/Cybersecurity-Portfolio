## 🔑 Key Concept

- **Types of Security Controls:** I learned there are different types of controls like technical (e.g., firewalls), managerial (like policies), operational (such as procedures), and physical (badges, locks). These help protect systems in different ways.

- **CIA Triad:** Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are the three big ideas that guide everything in cybersecurity. Basically: keep data secret, accurate, and accessible.

- **Obfuscation:** This just means hiding or protecting sensitive data, using things like data masking or tokenization.

## 🛠️ Tools/Techniques

- **Encryption & Hashing** – used to protect data  
- **Data Masking / Tokenization** – for hiding sensitive info  
- **Permission Restrictions / Segmentation** – controlling who can access what  
- **Gap Analysis** – figuring out what’s missing in a security setup

## 🛡️ SOC Relevance

- Knowing about controls helps you understand **how security is implemented** in real environments.
- The CIA Triad is super important when **analyzing logs or incidents**—you always want to know *what's at risk*.
- Data protection methods like hashing or masking come up when **investigating breaches** or designing better defenses.

## 📝 Summary

This chapter was a good intro to the core ideas that cybersecurity is built on. I started learning how different types of security controls are used to protect systems and people. The CIA triad came up a lot, and I now see how everything ties back to keeping data safe and usable. It also covered things like risk identification and different ways to protect data at rest or in transit. Still wrapping my head around some of it, but it’s starting to make sense!
