## 🔑 Key Concept

- **Social Engineering** is when attackers trick people into giving up info or doing something that helps the attacker — like clicking bad links or giving up passwords.  
- **Phishing, Vishing, and Smishing** are common ways attackers reach people by email, phone, or text.  
- **Password Attacks** like brute force and spraying try a bunch of usernames and passwords until one works.

## 📝 Summary

This chapter was all about how attackers use *people* to break into systems — not just software bugs. They might pretend to be someone else, spread fake info, or send tricky emails. It also covered password attacks where attackers guess or try lots of passwords until they get in.

Learning this stuff made me more aware of how creative attackers can be, and how important it is to train users and spot these kinds of tricks early.
